# Web_Scrapping
## NIFTY 50 Web Scraping & Analysis Project
This project focuses on scraping NIFTY 50 data from the Moneycontrol website using Selenium, storing it in a CSV file, and analyzing it to derive meaningful insights.

## Key Features
### 1. Web Scraping with Selenium:
- Installed and configured a web driver for automated data extraction.
- Scraped live NIFTY 50 data from Moneycontrol.

### 2.Data Storage & Processing:
- Stored the extracted data in a structured CSV file.
- Cleaned and processed the data using Pandas.

### 3.Data Analysis & Visualization:
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on NIFTY 50 trends.
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify key patterns.

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Selenium, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Selenium WebDriver for web scraping
- Jupyter Notebook for running the analysis
  
### Insights & Outcomes
- Successfully extracted and stored real-time NIFTY 50 data.
- Conducted data-driven analysis to explore trends and fluctuations.
- Enhanced skills in web scraping, automation, and financial data analysis.

### Project Structure
- nifty50_scraper.py: Script to scrape data using Selenium.
- nifty50_data.csv: The extracted dataset.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis and visualizations.
